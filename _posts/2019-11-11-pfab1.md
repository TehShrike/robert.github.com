Welcome to week 1 of Programming Feedback for Advanced Beginners.

In this series I review a program sent to me by one of my advanced beginner readers. I analyze their code, highlight the things that I like, and disucss the things that I think could be better. Most of all, I suggest small and big changes that the author could make in order to bring their program up to a professional standard.

## This week's program - Tic-Tac-Toe

This week's program was sent to me by Tiffany Tifflberry (not her real name) (obviously) (can you imagine?). Tiffany has written a solution for [Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners #3: Tic-Tac-Toe][ppab3]. Her code is very clean and well structured. She's written 4 increasingly sophisticated AI players, as well as a thrilling gauntlet program in which they fight each other to the death.

Nonetheless, I've spotted a few interesting ways in which I think she could make her code even cleaner. This week we're going to talk about how she could harden the boundaries between the different components of her program, and why this would be a good idea.

[Take a look at TIffany's code](code).

## How the program works

Tiffany stores the positions of the pieces in her board in a *2-dimensional list*, or *list of lists*:

```
board = [
  ["X", None, "O"],
  [None, "X", None],
  ["O", None, "X"]
]
```

This allows her to reference squares on her board using an intuitive co-ordinate-style syntax:

```
x = 2
y = 0
board[x][y] = "O"
```

Since lists are *0-indexed* (i.e. to access the first element you pass in an index of `0`, like `mylist[0]`) and a tic-tac-toe board is 3-by-3 in size, her program must access her board data-structure using co-ordinates with values between 0 and 2.

Tiffany asks her human players to input their moves by typing co-ordinates into the terminal. In her user interface (UI) she numbers her rows and columns from 1-3 (we'll call this type of input *1-3-form*, a term that I just made up). She judges this numering scheme to be more intuitive for her players than *0-2-form* (also a made up term), which is what her board data-structure expects.

```
  1 2 3
--------
1:X X X
2:- O -
3:O - O

X co-ordinate? 3
Y co-ordinate? 1
```

This is a very reasonable design decision that I fully support. UI design should be driven by the needs of the user, and should not be beholden to details of the internal system behind them.

However, the way in which Tiffany translates between 1-3-form and 0-2-form is rather ragged, and unnecessarily ties the UI and the internals together. Let's see why, and how we can improve it.

### The problem

The root cause of the program's problems is that most of the methods that deal with co-ordinates expect to receive their co-ordinate arguments in 1-3-form. The methods are then responsible for converting this into 0-2-form themselves. For example, the method that updates the board looks like this:

```python
def update(self, coord, player):
    """
    Sets a position on a board for a player. No check if position is legal
    done at this point
    """
    # EDITOR'S NOTE: here we subtract 1 from each co-ordinate
    # in order to convert from 1-3-form to 0-2-form. This is required
    # so that we can enter the move into our board.
    x_coord = coord[0] - 1
    y_coord = coord[1] - 1
    if self.board[x_coord][y_coord] is None:
        self.board[x_coord][y_coord] = player
    else:
        raise ValueError("position already filled")
```

Because these methods accept co-ordinate arguments in 1-3-form, they are forever having to translate arguments from 1-3-form into 0-2-form so that they can interact with the board's list-of-lists data structure. This is a shame, because it means that the internals of the program are being forced to care about the form in which the user inputs their moves. This makes the internal board code more complex, fiddly, and difficult to reason about ("OK so I know that this variable is a co-ordinate, but is it a 0-2 or a 1-3?"). Plus, if we wanted to change the way that the user's inputted their moves, or the way in which we internally represented the state of the game, we would have to update both the input code, *and* the internal logic.

This means that two separate components of the program are forced to care about how the other works. They are *coupled* together unnecessarily.

## Solution

I would like us to make the decision that every method in the program is only allowed to communicate with the rest of the program using 0-2-form. The code that gets input from users should receive it in the 1-3-form that is most intuitive to humans, but then immediately and permanently translate this raw input into 0-2-form for consumption by the rest of the code. This means that rest of the program neither knows nor cares that the input it received was originally provided in 1-3-form.

Making this change doesn't require any complex changes, just a reorganizing of the logic that we're already doing. We have to change this (simplified pseudo-code):

```python
def update_board(board, co_ords, player):
    """Accepts 1-3-form co-ordinates, and then immediately
    translates to 0-2-form."""
    x = co_ords[0] - 1
    y = co_ords[1] - 1
    # ... update the board ...

def get_user_coordinates():
    """Returns 1-3-form co-ordinates"""
    x_inp = input("X co-ordinate?: ")
    y_inp = input("Y co-ordinate?: ")
    return (x_inp, y_inp)

player = "X"
co_ords = get_user_coordinates()
update_board(board, co_ords, player)
```

to something more like this:

```python
def update_board(board, co_ords, player):
    """Now accepts 0-2-form co-ordinates, meaning that we don't
    have to do any translation."""
    x = co_ords[0]
    y = co_ords[1]
    # ... update the board ...

def get_user_coordinates():
    """Now returns 0-2-form co-ordinates"""
    x_inp = input("X co-ordinate?: ")
    y_inp = input("Y co-ordinate?: ")
    return (x_inp - 1, y_inp - 1)

player = "X"
co_ords = get_user_coordinates()
update_board(board, co_ords, player)
```

This approach has several benefits:

* It allows us to simplify our internal logic code, because it no longer has to worry about translating between co-ordinate forms. In addition, readers of the code no longer have to worry about whether the co-ordinate they are looking at is in 1-3-form or 0-2-form - it is now *always* in 0-2-form.
* This structure gives us very clear boundaries between components of our code, and standardizes the way in which they communicate with each other. We completely *decouple* the input component of our program from the internal logic component. We are now completely free to change our input component without having to worry about how this will affect the rest of our logic. For example, we could very easily do something extreme like switch from numerical co-ordinates to chess-style letter-number ones (F3, G6, H1). We would just have to update our `get_user_coordinates` function so that it accepts chess-squares from the user, but immediately translates these squares into the same type of numerical co-ordinates that it was returning before. The logic component can stay entirely unchanged. Making change's like this without clean boundaries between components is much, much harder.

## Why bother?

This might seem like an absurd amount of fuss over the exact right place to add and subtract a 1. But this kind of detail, repeated enough times, is what dictates whether a 100,000 line program will be gratifying or grisly to work with and understand.

Another example - in a video game, the game's internal engine code almost certainly never refers to specific buttons. It doesn't think `if button == "A" then move_character_up()`. What if the player remapped the buttons on their controller to different commands? What if the game was ported to an entirely different platform that didn't have an "A" button? Instead, there's a translation component between the user input and the engine, which turns button presses into commands and then uses those commands to update the game state. This gives us something conceptually closer to `if button == "A" then command = "JUMP"` and then `if command == "JUMP" then move_character_up()`. If you want to port your game to PlayStation then you just change the input component to `if button == "X" then command = "JUMP"`

## Next time

Next week we'll talk about how we can split up Tiffany's `Board` class into several smaller classes with more tightly-defined responsibilities. Don't miss it. In the meantime:
