title: Who wants to do some programming?
published: false

I’m going to experiment with doing an hour of pair programming a week over Skype or Screenhero with anyone who wants to on whatever they want to. This could be:

* Getting through the [Rails Tutorial](TODO)
* Practicing interview questions
* Designing a new programming language that compiles to Javascript
* Training a Recurrent Neural Network to do something bizarre with a stream of Tweets
* Basically anything you’re doing at the moment that you could use a sentient [rubber duck](TODO) for

I can’t guarantee I’ll have anything useful to say about what you’re working on, but I find that this often matters less than you might think. I imagine this will be of most interest to people with some amount of programming experience who don’t (yet) work as a programmer or who are early in their career. But I’d also be extremely open to working on a side project with a multi-decade industry veteran, or going through the first few exercises on [Codecademy](TODO).

If you’re interested then please send me an email with:

* What you’d like to work on
* A tiny bit about yourself
* What times are usually good for you (I’m on [PST](TODO) and work normal (in the European sense of the word) hours)

If there are more people interested that there are hours in one hour a week then I’ll use an arbitrary algorithm that I have yet to decide on in order to figure out what to do.

## About me

I’ve been a software engineer for 5 years, the last 3 of which I’ve spent at [Stripe](TODO), where I work on building infrastructure for machine learning. I mostly use Ruby, Python and Scala, but we’ll probably understand each other in most languages. I’ve written a number of quite popular blog posts on security and programming. I’m trying this out because I think it will be fun and I think it will make me feel warm and fuzzy and cool inside.
